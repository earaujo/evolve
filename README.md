# Evolve ![Travis-CI status](https://travis-ci.org/earaujoassis/evolve.svg?branch=master "Travis-CI status")

> A library for Evolutionary Computation algorithms

Evolve is a C library for metaheuristics algorithms. They are: genetic algorithm, In Vitro Fertilization
genetic algorithm (IVF-GA), ev (a very simple metaheuristic introduced in *Evolutionary Computation*, by
Kenneth De Jong), and some other implementation stubs.

## Setup & Running

Clone this project and load its submodules

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:earaujoassis/evolve.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install build dependencies: on Linux/Ubuntu systems it would be something like `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential texinfo`;
on other systems, please make sure to have GCC, Texinfo and The Autotools installed.

Build Evolve's dependencies and Evolve's library (all static libraries)

```sh
$ make dependencies
$ make build
```

3. Build and run an example for the Multidimensional 0-1 Knapsack Problem

```sh
$ make examples
$ build/examples/knapsack examples/knapsack/instances/mknapcb0.txt
```

## Testing

Install Valgrind prior to running any further command. Also, make sure to build the library following
previous steps.

```sh
$ make tests
```

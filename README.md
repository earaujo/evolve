# Evolve ![Travis-CI status](https://travis-ci.org/earaujoassis/evolve.svg?branch=master "Travis-CI status")

> A library for Evolutionary Computation algorithms

Evolve is a C library for metaheuristics algorithms. They are: genetic algorithm, In Vitro Fertilization
genetic algorithm (IVF-GA), ev (a very simple metaheuristic introduced in *Evolutionary Computation*, by
Kenneth De Jong), and some other implementation stubs.

## Build & Install

You must install Autotools before attempting to build & install it.

```sh
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

## Running the examples

```sh
$ autoreconf -i
$ mkdir -p build
$ CPPFLAGS=-I$PWD/build/include LDFLAGS=-L$PWD/lib ./configure --prefix=$PWD/build --disable-shared
$ make thirdparty
$ make
$ make install
$ make examples
$ examples/bin/2d-parabola
$ examples/bin/m-01-knapsack examples/m-01-knapsack-instance.txt
```

## Testing

Install Valgrind prior to running any further command. Also, make sure to build the library following
previous steps for running the examples.

```sh
$ make tests
```

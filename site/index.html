      <h2>What Evolve offers?</h2>
      <p>Genetic algorithms are implemented and some breeding and mutation strategies are also available. The currect implementation doesn’t offer much customization, but we’re working on that.</p>

      <h2>May I contribute?</h2>
      <p>Sure you can. We're trying to struggle the C language to offer an elegant and full speed archicture to solve non-trivial computational problems through evolutionary computation.</p>
